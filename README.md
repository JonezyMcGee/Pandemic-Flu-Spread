The simulation starts with patient zero having a 2% chance of infecting any susceptible child marked as 'o' on day one. 
Each subsequent infected child also has a probability of infecting any susceptible child of 2% and each child is independent. 
Infected children are contagious for three days before becoming healthy. 
Previously sick students cannot become sick from the virus a second time.
The total probability of being infected is calculated each day and then each subsceptible child is tested to see if they became infected.
The function records and returns some key metrics.
